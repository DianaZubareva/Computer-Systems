    <h1>Generations of Computers</h1>
    <p>There are 4 generations of computers</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Vacuum Tubes</li>
      <li>Transistors</li>
      <li>Integrated Circuits</li>
      <li>Micro-processors</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>First Generation of Computers</h2>
    <h3>Vacuum Tubes (1940-1956)</h3>
    <div>
      <p>The technology behind the primary generation computers was a fragile glass device, which was called vacuum tubes. These computers were very heavy and really large in size. These weren’t very reliable and programming on them was a really tedious task as they used low-level programming language and used no OS. First-generation computers were used for calculation, storage, and control purpose. They were too bulky and large that they needed a full room and consume rot of electricity.</p>

    <h2>Second Generation of Computers</h2>
    <h3>Transistors (1956-1963)</h3>
    <p>Second-generation computers used the technology of transistors rather than bulky vacuum tubes. Another feature was the core storage. A transistor may be a device composed of semiconductor material that amplifies a sign or opens or closes a circuit.<br>Transistors were invented in Bell Labs. The use of transistors made it possible to perform powerfully and with due speed. It reduced the dimensions and price and thankfully the warmth too, which was generated by vacuum tubes. Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, programming language and input, and output units also came into the force within the second  generation.<br>Programming language was shifted from high level to programming language and made programming comparatively a simple task for programmers. Languages used for programming during this era were FORTRAN (1956), ALGOL (1958), and COBOL (1959).</p>

    <h2>Thrid Generation of Computers</h2>
    <h3>Integrated Circuits. (1964-1971)</h3>
    <p>During the third generation, technology envisaged a shift from huge transistors to integrated circuits, also referred to as IC. Here a variety of transistors were placed on silicon chips, called semiconductors. The most feature of this era’s computer was the speed and reliability. IC was made from silicon and also called silicon chips.<br>A single IC, has many transistors, registers, and capacitors built on one thin slice of silicon. The value size was reduced and memory space and dealing efficiency were increased during this generation. Programming was now wiped out Higher level languages like BASIC (Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code). Minicomputers find their shape during this era.</p>

    <h2>Forth Generation of Computers</h2>
    <h3>Micro-processors (1971-Present)</h3>
    <p>In 1971 First microprocessors were used, the large scale of integration LSI circuits built on one chip called microprocessors. The most advantage of this technology is that one microprocessor can contain all the circuits required to perform arithmetic, logic, and control functions on one chip.<br>The computers using microchips were called microcomputers. This generation provided the even smaller size of computers, with larger capacities. That’s not enough, then Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits replaced LSI circuits. The Intel 4004chip, developed in 1971, located all the components of the pc from the central processing unit and memory to input/ output controls on one chip and allowed the dimensions to reduce drastically.<br>Technologies like multiprocessing, multiprogramming, time-sharing, operating speed, and virtual memory made it a more user-friendly and customary device. The concept of private computers and computer networks came into being within the fourth generation.</p>
